# Pakistan: A Labor Market Analysis
## Best Practice Trends in Facilitating Remittance Flows during COVID-19

### Executive Summary

Key Economic, Poverty and Labor Market Trends
• Pakistan’s growth is affected by repeated periods of economic volatility. Between 2000 and
2017, Pakistan underwent cycles of economic volatilities. In particular, the period of boom, between 2000
and 2005, bust between 2006 and 2011, and recovery between 2012 and 2017 (Figure 1a).
• Demographic Transition, Gender and Working Age. Due to population growth, youth
bulge and slow urbanization the country is undergoing a demographic change. More individuals are
entering the working age than the population growth of the country, 40.04 percent of the population
between the age of 15-24. Women constitute half of the country’s population however gender disparities
in all fields exist. Nonetheless, women’s exit from labor force and thereby unemployment is based on
choice, in particular for relatively educated women in the urban areas where the FLFP rates has remained
stagnant at around 10 percent in last two decades. In comparison in lower quantiles, women tend to work
out of necessity and due to poverty.
• Pakistan has made good progress in poverty reduction. Pakistan had high incidence of poverty;
however, the country has shown strong signs of poverty reduction in last 20 years. Analysis of national
poverty line indicate a decrease in poverty from 36.8 to 24.3 percent between 2010-15. But Gini index or
income inequality has increased from 29.80 to 31.60 between 2009-19 suggesting low quality and low
paying jobs in the country.
• Labor Force. Pakistan has the nineth largest labor force in the world; however, the country's labor
resource is highly underutilized. Half of the working age population is not engaging in the labor market.
The country has a high dependency ratio. In particular, A large population of eligible female and youth
is dependent on small share of income generating workers.
• Pakistan has a large informal sector – 71.7% of the labor force. Informality is primarily in own
account workers, small business owners and employees. In key sectors it is due to non-contractual or daily
wage jobs. Crafts & related trade sector accounts for the highest female informality, 59.7 percent. It is
mainly due preference of female workers to work from home. In comparison, it is lowest in contributing
family members and employers or public sector workers.
• The country has low labor force participation and large gender gaps exists in female labor force
participation. Almost half of working age population, 54.21 percent, is not engaged in the labor market.
Out of the participating population, an average of only 23.34 percent constitutes female labor force
indicating large gender gaps. Rural FLFP has shown increasing trends however stagnation in urban FLFP
rates indicate the female participation is by choice and women tend to work out of necessity or due to
poverty. In addition, female with advance education exit from the labor market primarily due to marriages,
dependence on other income generating (male) members of the household, and other social norm.
• Overall unemployment is low however much higher for the highly educated. Overall
unemployment in Pakistan has increased by an average of 2.71 percent of the total labor force. However,
low unemployment rates, 4.65 percent, is primarily due to income generating activities in the informal
sector. Unemployment is relatively high for relatively well-educated workforce due to mismatch between
job seeker and available jobs.
• Wage Rates. The country is experiencing a transformation towards an overall increase in wage
employment; however, it is predominantly for men. Although wage rate disparity is high in most sector
but introduction of digital services like Airbnb and car-sharing applications like Uber has contributed to
a balance in wage disparity in favor of female workers who prefer to work from home.
• Employment. Pakistan has experienced a net increase in employment in the last two
decades, however, each sector's ability to create jobs varies over time, across rural-urban divide and with
gender disparities. Service sector is the largest job market; however, it is stagnating as compared to
industrial sector. Agriculture sector provides a buffer during the period of economic bust. During 2012-
4
17, the number of jobs in the service sector which fell by 760,000 indicating a change in sectoral share of
employment. However, there was an increase in number of jobs in industry sector indicating some
structural transformation, however it is at the expanse of the service sectors rather than agriculture sector.
Migration, Remittances and the Impact of COVID-19
• Migration. Pakistan is the 2nd largest labor exporting country in South Asia after India.
• Majority of 11.4 million emigrant population is settled in the GCC and the G20 countries (Figure
33 b). In 2021, Saudi Arabia accounted for the largest share emigrants, 5.68 million, followed by UAE
with 3.93 million (Figure 34).
• Occupational skill and category-based analysis of emigrants indicate that most of the emigrants
are low skilled workers (Figure 35 a & b).
•
• Remittance Increase During COVID-19. Major COVID Shift from Informal to Formal
Remittance Sending
• Remittances to Pakistan has grown considerably by USD 11.93 billion between 2011-20. In 2020-
21, remittances have decreased globally due to COVID-19 whereas for Pakistan the COVID-19 trends
indicate a steady increase in remittances inflow (Figure 37a).
• A 3-year analysis on a monthly inflow of remittances to Pakistan indicate that during the financial
year 2021 remittances surpassed the USD 2 billion mark for 10 consecutive months (Figure 37b).
• A year-on-year growth analysis indicates that between July to March, year on year average
growth between FY 2019-20 was 5.45 percent. In comparison, during the same time period, year-on-
year average growth between FY 2020-21 was 20.47 percent, an increase of 15.01 percent despite the
global pandemic (Figure 37b).
• The most evident reason for the increase in remittance is a shift from informal channels like
hundi and hawala and money smuggling to formal means of sending remittances.
Best Practices Identified
Best Practice #1: Global drop in cost of remittances across Pakistan Corridor supports an
increase in remittance flows during the Pandemic.
• The declining cost of remittances played a pivotal role for an increase in Pakistan’s remittance
inflow. The decline in cost of remittances from regions with large Pakistani population incentivized the
use of banking and other formal channels leading to an overall increase in net remittance inflow between
2020 and 2021.
• The largest change was seen for Saudi Arabia which account for 5.68 million Pakistani emigrants
(Figure 39). Similar trends were visible in other regions with large Pakistani emigrants. However,
increasing trends, in cost of remittance are visible in the first quarter of 2021, 0.40 percent (Figure 39 and
40). An increase in cost remittance may risk emigrants shifting back to informal menans of sending
remittances which could adversely affect remittance inflow to Pakistan.
Best Practice #2: channels.
Pandemic travel restrictions enable gains to Pakistan's efforts to implement
strict anti-money laundering regulations supporting a shift in remittance flows from informal to formal
• Since 2018, Pakistan is in the process of implementing strong anti-money laundering
regulations due to its grey listed status by FATF.

• The COVID-19 pandemic prevented air travel which led to a halt in transfer of hard cash and
money smuggling via air travel.
• The combination of the inability of emigrants to travel with hard cash and a strict
implementation of anti-money laundering regulations is forcing a transition of remittance from informal
to formal channels.
Best Practice #3: The government has introduced Roshan Digital Account to provide user friendly and
accessible banking services to emigrants abroad.
• The State Bank of Pakistan in collaboration with commercial banks in Pakistan started online
banking service for Pakistani emigrants – Digital Roshan Bank Account.
• The initiative enables Pakistani emigrants to open bank account digitally in any of the
commercial bank in Pakistan without travelling to Pakistan.
• By February of 2021, RDA initiative crossed the USD 500 million mark2 and on 23 April 2021
the initiative broke the USD 1 billion mark in terms of facilitating remittance inflow in the country.

### Pakistan at a Glance

According to the World Bank classification, Pakistan is a low-middle income country (LMIC) in the
South Asian region bordering China, India, Afghanistan, Iran, and the Arabian sea. It is the sixth most
populous country globally, with a population of 220.6 million, a population growth rate of 2.3, and a male
to female ratio of 1.06 in 2020. The majority of the population, around 65 percent, lives in rural areas.
The country has seen impressive poverty reduction despite short-term volatilities and macroeconomic
vulnerabilities. The economy has experienced repeated cycles of boom, bust, and recovery.
Despite economic volatilities, Pakistan is on a growth path. In the last two decades, the country saw an
increase in overall household income and remittances from international migrants. It also underwent a
growth in informal economic activity associated with urbanization and household enterprise. These
factors led to substantial poverty reduction from 64.3 percent in 2001 to 24.3 percent3
. As a result, despite
economic downturns, Pakistan's economy is resilient, and the country is aspiring to become an upper-
middle-income country by 2047.4
However, Pakistan faces acute challenges in its labor market due to the high supply of labor force and
shortage of quality jobs. The country's population continues to grow and exert pressure on its limited
resources, both financial and physical. With the increasing population growth, the country provides
abundant labor supply both national and international; specifically, the youth bulge, as the number of
young individuals entering the labor market increases more than the population growth. The country can
turn this resource into dividends if the economy can absorb the young workers entering the labor market
by providing quality jobs.

## SECTION – I
### Overview of Pakistan

### **1. Macroeconomics Overview**

**1.1 Growth Trends** Pakistan, with a GNI per capita of USD 14105 in 2019, ranks 162nd
globally, almost the lowest in South Asia, just above Nepal and Afghanistan (see Figure 1a). On the other
hand, the country was ranked 154 globally in terms of nominal GDP per capita of USD 1186 and a PPP
GDP per capita of USD 5839 in 2019 (6). In a regional comparison, Bangladesh, other south Asian
economies did relatively well between 2000 and 2017, whereas in Pakistan's case, economic volatilities
are visible during the same period. In particular, during the period of boom, between 2000 and 2005,
bust between 2006 and 2011, and recovery between 2012 and 2017 (Figure 1a).

1.2 During the recovery period, the country's real GDP has grown at a steady average GDP growth
rate of 3.13 percent from 0.4 to 3.3 percent between 2009-18. Similarly, the country's GDP per capita rate increased from negative 0.60 to 3.68 percent during the same period. However, afterward, it dropped
to a negative 1.04 percent in 2019 (Figure 2). Despite an increase in GDP growth rates and value addition
by key sectors, particularly the service sector (Figure 1b), the country has a large current and fiscal account
deficit and reliance on external loans, which increased between 2009 and 2018. The trends indicate that
growth did not increase labor market productivity and exports; instead, the government relied heavily on
imports, external loans, and foreign assistance.
